            <h1>About Dashrath Manjhi</h1>
            <h2>Dashrath Manjhi, also known as the <b>"Mountain Man" </b>of India, was a remarkable individual who dedicated
                over two decades of his life to carve a path through a mountain using only a chisel and hammer. Born
                in 1934 in the Gehlaur village of Bihar, India, Manjhi's determination and resilience have inspired
                people around the world.</h2>
            <h2>Manjhi's extraordinary feat came from a deep sense of love and devotion to his community. The mountain
                stood as a barrier between his village and essential resources, making it difficult for villagers to
                access medical facilities, schools, and markets. Instead of accepting the status quo, Manjhi decided
                to take matters into his own hands.</h2>
            <h2>With sheer determination and relentless effort, Manjhi worked tirelessly for 22 years, chiseling away
                at the rocky terrain to create a road that reduced the travel distance from his village to the nearest
                town from 55 kilometers to just 15 kilometers. His perseverance and selflessness earned him the
                admiration of people worldwide.</h2>
            <h2>Dashrath Manjhi's legacy continues to inspire generations, reminding us that with unwavering resolve
                and dedication, even the seemingly impossible can be achieved.</h2>
