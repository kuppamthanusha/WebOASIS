# OIBSIP - Oasis Infobyte Intern Program


OASIS INFOBYTE offers a variety of website design and development services. Got the chance for 1 month intern of Web development and design. 
There are 3 task given to complete. After completing all tasks, if everything looks fine, the intern will be certified. 
Glad to be a part of OASIS INFOBYTE intern program.


## Task1 - Calculator
A Calculator created under the virtual internship program of Oasis Infobyte. <br>

It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
It will need a  display screen to display the userâ€™s input and give the results. The grid system in CSS is for the alignments of buttons on the calculator. The additional tools you need to build a fully functional calculator include eventListeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and so on.
